    <div class="introduction">
      <p>
        By signing the Inflation Reduction Act, President Biden is delivering on
        his promise to build an economy that works for working families,
        including Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AA and
        NHPI) families.
      </p>
      <p>
        President Biden and Congressional Democrats beat back the special
        interests to pass this historic legislation that lowers costs for
        Americans and their families, advances environmental justice while
        building a cleaner future, and grows the economy from the bottom up and
        the middle out.

    <div class="first-section">
      <h2>LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS</h2>
      <p>
        The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) will lower health care costs,
        including prescription drug costs, and expand health insurance coverage
        for AA and NHPI families.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for prescription drugs
          at $2,000 a year.
        </li>
        <li>
          Caps the amount that seniors will have to pay for insulin at $35 for a
          monthâ€™s supply.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provides access to additional free vaccines for Medicare
          beneficiaries.

      <h2>MAKE THE TAX CODE FAIRER</h2>
      <p>
        The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is a critical step forward in making
        our tax code fairer. It will raise revenue by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ensuring that high-income people and large corporations pay the taxes
          they already owe.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cracking down on large, profitable corporations that currently get
          away with paying no federal income tax.
        </li>
        <li>Imposing a 1% surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No family making less than $400,000 per year will see their taxes go up
        by a single cent.
